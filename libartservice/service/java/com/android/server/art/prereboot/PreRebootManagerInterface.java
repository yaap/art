/**
 * The interface for the entry point of Pre-reboot Dexopt, called through reflection from an old
 * version of the ART module. This interface must be kept stable from one version of the ART module
 * to another. In principle, a method here should be kept as long as devices that receive Mainline
 * updates call it from their old factory installed modules, unless there is a good reason to drop
 * the Pre-reboot Dexopt support earlier for certain versions of the ART module.
 *
 * Dropping the support for certain versions will only make devices lose the opportunity to optimize
 * apps before the reboot, but it won't cause severe results such as crashes because even the oldest
 * version that uses this interface can elegantly handle reflection exceptions.
 *
 * During Pre-reboot Dexopt, the new version of this code is run.
 *
 * Methods in this interface must not take an instance of a class defined in `service-art.jar`. See
 * comments in {@link PreRebootDriver#runFromChroot} for the reason.
